Image Fetching &amp; Timer Demo Projects

These are a few of the projects we've done with Android over the past week. In order to incorporate them into Android studio do the following:

<b>1.</b> Start up Android Studio, and select "Open an Existing Android Studio Project" from the main menu.<br/><br/>
<b>2.</b> Navigate to either project and choose the <b>top level</b> build.gradle ( such as ImageFetcherDemo/build.gradle ), NOT the folder.<br/><br/>
<b>3.</b> Android Studio will set everything up and you should be good to go!<br/>
